# Introduction to Python

In this session we will be introduced to the Python programming language. 

A useful resource for the is the online documentation available on [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2.7/tutorial/).

Note that the above link refers to Python version 2.7, which is the version used on your virtual machine. 
Python 3 is preferred in many cases but the programming concepts covered will be similar in most cases covered here. 
For those curious about the differences, the tutorial has a tab in the top left to switch between versions.
