#example 1
#Write an R function that reads two numbers, multiplies them together and prints out their
#product.
a <- 2
b <- 3
product.two <- a*b

#example 2
#Write an R function that tells a user that the number they entered is not a 5 or a 6. You can read input from the keyboard with num in <- readline(prompt="Enter a number: ").
num_in <- readline(prompt = "Enter a number")
if(num_in == 5) 
{print("Your number is 5")
} else
{print("Your number is not 5") 
}
if(num_in == 6)
{print("Your number is 6")
} else
{print("Your number is not 6")} 

#Example 3
#Write an R function that performs the following: Ask a user to enter a number. If the number
#is between 0 and 10, write the word blue. If the number is between 10 and 20, write the word
#red. If the number is between 20 and 30, write the word green. If it is any other number,
#write that it is not a correct color option.

value <-readline(prompt = "enter a number")
if(value == 1:10)
{print("blue")
} else
  if (value == 10:20) 
  {print("red")
  } else
    if (value == 20:30) 
    {print("green")
    } else
      print("Not a correct color option")

#Example 4
#Write an R function to print all multiples of 5 between 1 and n (possibly including n)
x_values <- seq(1, n, by=1)

f <- x_values*5

return(f)

#Example 5: need further help
#Write an R function that will count all the even numbers up to a user deﬁned stopping point
num <- readline(prompt="Enter a stopping point: ")
nums <- seq(0,num)
if((nums %% 2) == 0) {
  count.fields(nums))


#Write an R function that will perform the following.
#a) Read in 5 separate numbers.
five.nums <- runif(5,min=0, max=20)
#b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
mean(five.nums)
#c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
five.min <- min(five.nums)
five.max <- max(five.nums)
#d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing the results,
#i.e. maximum is ....
print(five.min)
print(five.max)
