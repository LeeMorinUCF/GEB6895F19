# SQL_in_R shows how to execute SQL queries
#   using tables read as dataframes from csv files.
#   The SQL queries are used to aggregate and join data 
#   and output data frames.
# 
# Dependencies:
#   library(sqldf)

# FAIL: Not all pakages support outer joins.
# It is just a regular merge without much SQL machinery anyway.

# Most queries can be executed with left joins. 
# It is a matter of choosing the table on the left.
