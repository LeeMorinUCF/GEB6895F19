# Coding Practice Exercises

## Pseudocode

Work with pseudocode to sketch a program that you intend to write. The following is an  excellent description taken from the website referenced below in a document called [Pseudo Code Practice Problems](https://www.qacps.org/cms/lib02/MD01001006/Centricity/Domain/847/Pseudo_Code%20Practice_Problems.pdf).

Pseudo code can be broken down into five components.
- Variables
- Assignment
- Input/output
- Selection
- Repetition

### Variables

A variable has a name, a data type, and a value. There is a location in memory associated with each variable. A variable
can be called anything or be given any name. It is considered good practice to use variable names that are relevant to
the task at hand.

### Assignment

Assignment is the physical act of placing a value into a variable. Assignment can be shown using
```
set = 5;
set = num + set;
```

The left side is the variable a value is being stored in and the right side is where the variable is being accessed. When a
variable is assigned a value, the old value is written over with the new value so the old value is gone. ```x = 5``` does not
mean that x is equal to 5; it means set the variable x to have the value 5. Give x the value 5, make x equal to 5.

### Input / Output

Input / Output both deal with an outside source (can be a user or another program) receiving or giving information. An
example would be to think of a fast food restaurant as a program. A driver (user) would submit their order for a burger
and fries (input), they would then drive to the side window and pick up their ordered meal (output.)
- Output – Write / display / print
- Input – Read / get / input

### Selection

Selection construct allows for a choice between performing an action and skipping it. It is our conditional statements.
Selection statements are written as such:
```
if ( conditional statement)
  statement list
else
  statement list
```

### Repetition

Repetition is a construct that allows instructions to be executed multiple times (i.e. repeated).
In a repetition problem
– Count is initialized
- Condition is Tested
- Statement is executed
– Count is incremented

Repetition problems are shown as:
```
while ( condition statement)
  statement list
```

A for loop is another such construction, which executes a statement for each item in a list. 
```
for ( item in list_of_items)
  statement list
```
