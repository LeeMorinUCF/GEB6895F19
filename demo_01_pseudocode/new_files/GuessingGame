'Write a guessing game where the user has to guess a secret number. 
'After every guess the program tells the user whether their number was too large or too small. 
'At the end the number of tries needed should be printed. 
'It counts only as one try if they input the same number multiple times consecutively.

Generate random number 'x'. 
Print 'Guess the number between 0 and 99'
Open textbox that allows user to input value with two numerical digits

Create 'Y', which has an initial value of 0
Create 'All Guesses' which stores previous input value

Loop

Retrieve numerical input from user
  If input is not numerical
    Print 'Please input a numerical value between 0-99'
  If input is numerical and < x
  OR
  If input is numerical and > x
    Print 'Try Again'
    If input does not equal 'All Guesses', Add 1 to 'Y'
  If input is numerical and = x
    If input does not equal 'All Guesses', Add 1 to 'Y'
    End Loop
    
Print 'Congratulations, you guessed the number and it only took you 'Y' tries'
