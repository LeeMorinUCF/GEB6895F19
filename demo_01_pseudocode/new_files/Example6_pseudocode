#Example 6: Write pseudo code that will perform the following.
#a) Read in 5 separate numbers.
#b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
#c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
#d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are


var arr[1] = read(num1);
var arr[2] = read(num2);
var arr[3] = read(num3);
var arr[4] = read(num4);
var arr[5] = read(num5);

var avg = ((arr[1] + arr[2] + arr[3] + arr[4] + arr[5])/5);



min = arr[1];
max = arr[1];
  
for (i =2 to 5){

  if arr[i] > max
    max = arr[i]
    
  if arr[i] < min
    min = arr[i]
    
}
print('average of 5 numbers is = ' + avg);

print('minimum of the 5 numbers read is = ' + min);
print('maximum of the 5 numbers read is = ' + max);
