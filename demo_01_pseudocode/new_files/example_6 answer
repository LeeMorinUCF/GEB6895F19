Set avg to (5+10+15+20+25)/5
If(5 < 10)
 Set max to 10
Else
 Set max to 5
If(15 > max)
 Set max to 15
If(20 > max)
 Set max to 20
If(25 > max)
Set max to 25
Write "The max is"
Write max


If(5 < 10)
 Set min to 5
Else
 Set min to 5
If(15 < min)
 Set min to 15
If(20 < min)
 Set min to 20
If(25 < min)
Set min to 25
