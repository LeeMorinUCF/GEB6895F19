Example 6: Write pseudo code that will perform the following.
a) Read in 5 separate numbers.
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are


var arr[1] = read(num1);
var arr[2] = read(num2);
var arr[3] = read(num3);
var arr[4] = read(num4);
var arr[5] = read(num5);

var avg = ((arr[1] + arr[2] + arr[3] + arr[4] + arr[5])/5);



min = arr[i];
max = arr[i];
  
for (i =2 to 5){

  if arr[i] > max
    max = arr[i]
    
  if arr[i] < min
    min = arr[i]
    
}
print('average of 5 numbers is = ' + avg);

print('minimum of the 5 numbers read is = ' + min);
print('maximum of the 5 numbers read is = ' + max);
